# Dijkstra A* search BFS AND DFS implementation
--the main implementaion of the graph is in Graph.py file 
---to test the algorithms based on the data provided on the book in the graph the Evaluation.py file is used 
---to plot graphs and to measure time and lengtt of randomly generated Nodes with 1x 2x 3x and 4x ... times the
   matploit.py file is used .
---any one can also create random nodes in the test.py file to test different algorithms in the graph.
---the txt files are the data we get from the book and also the randomly generated nodes list.
--when run it might take some time since it tries a lot of possibilities so wait till it finishes especially for matploit.py
